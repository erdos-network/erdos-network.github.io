            Welcome to the <b><a href = "https://github.com/erdos-network"> Erdős Network</a></b>, a community inspired by the legendary mathematician <b>Paul Erdős</b>
            and his boundless spirit of collaboration. We're building a space that connects researchers worldwide through
            shared authorship and the networks that grow from it.
            <br><br>Did you know?

        <ul>
            <li>Paul Erdős published with over <b>500 collaborators</b>.</li>
            <li>The playful concept of an <i>Erdős number</i> measures how close someone is to Erdős through co-authorship.</li>
            <li>Most researchers in math and computer science are within <b>six steps</b> of him.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>&#x1F9D9 Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            Our goal is to map the global community of math and science researchers, tracing the threads of collaboration to reveal
            how ideas spread. By making these networks visible, we hope to foster a tighter community amongst researchers around the world
            and foster new connections stemming from the most unlikely places.
        </p>
        <h2>&#x1F64b Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Erdős Network</b> is currently growing out of Ideas 2 Innovation at Amherst College.
            <br><br>We're a collective of curious minds: students, researchers, and developers who see collaboration as the heart of innovation.
        </p>
        <h2>&#10024 Join the Network</h2>
        <p>
            This is just the beginning. Multiple projects will grow under the <b>Erdős Network</b> umbrella.
            Our first initiative, <a href="https://github.com/erdos-network/erdos-graph">Erdős Graph</a>,
            is designed to calculate Erdős Numbers faster and more accurately than ever before.
            <br><br>Follow along, contribute, and help us map the world of ideas together. &#127757
